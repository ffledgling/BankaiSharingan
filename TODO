Things to do: 
- Integrate with a scheduler that can check if a new manga is up and Download the latest chapter.
- Make it compatible with other popular websites such as Mangafox, manga.animea.com etc.
- Add dialog and prompt for proxy (Hidden proxy handler already exists, Input UI is all that is needed) 
- *DEVELOP A GUI FRONT-END*
